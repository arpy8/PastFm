**Last.fm Scrobble Card for My GitHub Profile**

## Why I made this
I had been using the [spotify-github-profile](https://github.com/kittinan/spotify-github-profile) banner for a long time. But ever since spotify people decided to ban their modded app, I found myself jumping between different platforms to listen to music. Hence I wanted this banner to showcase my listening activity from every platform, so I made a custom version for me!
Also huge shoutout to [kittinan](https://github.com/kittinan). I used his default theme for the card, so it looks somewhat similar.

## Note
A same copy of this repository can be found on huggingface as well, where I've hosted the API.
